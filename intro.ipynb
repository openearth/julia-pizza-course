    ">We want a language that's open source, with a liberal license. We want the speed of C with the dynamism of Ruby. We want a language that's homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled."

The language was still in its infancy, so there were some issues, but it generally worked well and enabled us to process the billions of points for our project in Indonesia. The used and generated packages are now part of JuliaGeo: https://juliageo.org/, with geospatial libraries linked such as GDAL, GEOS, Proj etc."
